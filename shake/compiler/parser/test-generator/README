This is a basic project of javascript files used for generating unit tests for our shake parser.
We want to test as many weird edge cases as possible, so we can be sure that our parser is robust.
For that reason we've decided to automatically generate the tests.
You don't need to generate these tests yourself, they are committed to the repository.
This is the generator code, which is not part of the project, but is used to generate the tests.
